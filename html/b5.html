<p>
Cloud Storage is technology that allows you to save files in storage, and then access those files via the Cloud. Let's break down this definition. First, storage is the computer's ability to save files and other resources for later use. When you restart a computer, the files that are still available after the computer turns back on are saved and read from storage. Such storage commonly consists of a hard drive, a USB Flash drive, or another type of drive.
<br /><br />
Because local data drives can be damaged or stolen, an idea was developed to use data drives over a network as storage. This allows the drives to be secured in a data center and backed up automatically. Initially, network storage required fast local networks (LAN), but today we have a ubiquitous network called the Internet.
<br /><br />
The second part of Cloud Storage, the Cloud, represents the Internet. Any service, including storage, available over the Internet, is called Cloud service. If you use GMAIL it is email in the Cloud, if you use an Amazon MP3 player, that's music in the Cloud.
